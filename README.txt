Directions of how to run the program:
- You'll need to add the MySQL connector in the project settings as a java library 
- You may need to edit the configurations in IntelliJ to run the program. An easy way that I found was clicking the first
green run arrow on the left hand side inside of the Login class with the main method.
- The password for the login screen is test, and the username is test


Description of the additional report of your choice you ran in part A3f:
For the 3rd additional report I decided to pull data on the number of appointments each customer id has for each month.
